Assignment
1. Implement the following function to find an element in an unsorted array, using linear search.
boolean findUsingLinearSearch(int[] arr, int element);

2. Implement the following function to find an element in a sorted array, using binary search.
boolean findUsingBinarySearch(int[] arr, int element);
Hint: Sort the array using the sorting algorithm implemented below.

3. Implement the following function to sort the given array in descending order, using Bubble Sort
void bubbleSort(int[] arr);
Use the algorithm described in class to start from left side of array, to move smallest element towards the right end.


Exercise 1: Implement the above algorithms to sort elements in descending order.

Exercise 2: Implement Bubble Sort to start from right end of array, to bring appropriate element towards the left side.
