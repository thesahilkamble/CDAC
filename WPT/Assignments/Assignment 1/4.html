        <h2> Volcanoes </h2>
        <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.</p>
        <img src="volcano.jpg" height=200 width=200 align="left"><caption></caption>
        <p> On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or 
            converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge, 
            such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates 
            whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. 
            Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, 
            such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio 
            Grande Rift in North America. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated 
            to arise from upwelling diapirs from the coreâ€“mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers 
            (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the 
            Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic 
            plates slide past one another.</p>
        <p> According to the theory of plate tectonics, the Earth's lithosphere, 
            its rigid outer shell, is broken into sixteen larger plates and several 
            smaller plates. These are in slow motion, due to convection 
            in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes 
            place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere 
            is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created.)[3]</p>

        <h3>Divergent plate boundaries</h3>
        <p>Main article: Divergent boundary
        At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates 
        diverge from one another as hot mantle rock 
        creeps upwards beneath the thinned oceanic 
        crust. The decrease of pressure in the rising 
        mantle rock leads to adiabatic expansion and the 
        partial melting of the rock, causing volcanism and 
        creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate 
        boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans, and so 
        most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, 
        forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as 
        deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic
        activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea 
        level, volcanic islands are formed, such as Iceland.[4]</p>

        <h3>Convergent plate boundaries</h3>
        <p>Main article: Convergent boundary
        Subduction zones are places where two plates, 
        usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate, 
        collide. The oceanic plate subducts (dives beneath
        the continental plate), forming a deep ocean trench 
        just offshore. In a process called flux melting, 
        water released from the subducting plate lowers the 
        melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge, 
        thus creating magma. This magma tends to be extremely 
        viscous because of its high silica content, so it often 
        does not reach the surface but cools and solidifies 
        at depth. When it does reach the surface, however, 
        a volcano is formed. Thus subduction zones are bordered 
        by chains of volcanoes called volcanic arcs. 
        Typical examples are the volcanoes in the Pacific 
        Ring of Fire, such as the Cascade Volcanoes or the 
        Japanese Archipelago, or the Sunda Arc of Indonesia.[5]</p>

        <h3>Hotspots</h3>
        <p>Main article: Hotspot (geology)
        Hotspots are volcanic areas thought to be formed by 
        mantle plumes, which are hypothesized to be columns 
        of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary. 
        As with mid-ocean ridges, the rising mantle rock 
        experiences decompression melting which generates 
        large volumes of magma. Because tectonic plates move 
        across mantle plumes, each volcano becomes inactive 
        as it drifts off the plume, and new volcanoes are 
        created where the plate advances over the plume. 
        The Hawaiian Islands are thought to have been formed 
        in such a manner, as has the Snake River Plain, with 
        the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the 
        North American plate currently above the Yellowstone 
        hotspot.[6] However, the mantle plume hypothesis has
        been questioned.[7]</p>

        <h3>Continental rifting</h3>
        <p>Main article: Rift
        Sustained upwelling of hot mantle rock can 
        develop under the interior of a continent 
        and lead to rifting. Early stages of rifting 
        are characterized by flood basalts and may 
        progress to the point where a tectonic plate 
        is completely split.[8][9] A divergent plate
        boundary then develops between the two halves 
        of the split plate. However, rifting often fails 
        to completely split the continental lithosphere 
        (such as in an aulacogen), and failed rifts are
        characterized by volcanoes that erupt unusual 
        alkali lava or carbonatites. Examples include 
        the volcanoes of the East African Rift.[10]
