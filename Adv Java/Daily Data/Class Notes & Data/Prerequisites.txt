Dear All !
It has been a long time , since core Java.
I am not at all trying to scare you but trying to prepare you .
To be honest the pace of advanced Java n it's difficulty level will be higher.
Please revise as per the following instructions n we will definitely make the advanced Java module successful.

1. Login to mysql
2. use database acts_mar24;
3. drop table users;
4. Copy from , "prerequisites n revision\voting sql.txt"
DDL n DMLs for users n candidates tables.
We are going to use them for online voting case study.
5. 
Refer to "prerequisites n revision\JDBC code for revision\jdbc_demo"
import this as existing project in the core java workspace.
Edit DBUtils.java ,as per your DB settings

6. Trace completely JDBC layered application
Layers Tester-DAO (uses DBUtils) -entities -DB
It's a complete CRUD application.
Go through it , for complete revision of JDBC

7. From Collection framework , please revise ArrayList n HashMap
We will use them in advanced java.

8. Refer - "prerequisites n revision\web basics"
After your completion of WPT module , you may not need any of it . But it's always good to revise !

8.1 "prerequisites n revision\web basics\TCP IP Primer article link.txt"
8.2 "prerequisites n revision\web basics\HTTP_basics.txt"
8.3 "prerequisites n revision\web basics\web_server_basics.txt"
8.4 "prerequisites n revision\web basics\response content type.txt"

9. We are going to start with 
9.1 Invoking stored procedure with JDBC
9.2 Java Reflection overview
If you have gone through , "\prerequisites n revision\Java Reflection\readme.txt" , it will help you greatly.

That's all for now
Looking forward to seeing you soon !
